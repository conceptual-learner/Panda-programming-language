# Twirl-programming-language
A small programming language
Overview
Twirl is a small language that I built in my 3rd year of BTech. It supports various fundamental programming concepts such as variable-declaration, function calling, conditional statements, loops, proper order of operations, and calculation. The language syntax is meant to be very readable and intuitive. I used ANTLR 4 and JDK 13.0.1 to create Twirl. It is easy to use.
